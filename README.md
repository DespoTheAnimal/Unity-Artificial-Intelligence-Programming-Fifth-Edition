**Add powerful, believable, and fun AI entities in your game with the power of Unity**

## What is this book about?
Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for game characters in Unity 2021 has never been easier. Unity provides game and app developers with a variety of tools to implement AI, from basic techniques to cutting-edge machine learning-powered agents. Leveraging these tools via Unity's API or built-in features allows limitless possibilities when it comes to creating game worlds and characters.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand the basics of AI in game design
* Create smarter game worlds and characters with C# programming
* Apply automated character movement using pathfinding algorithm behaviors
* Implement character decision-making algorithms using behavior trees
* Build believable and highly efficient artificial flocks and crowds
